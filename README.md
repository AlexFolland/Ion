Ion
===

Ion is an action bar addon for World of Warcraft.  It's really good, though has some bugs between versions.  This is my fork that has some fixes by other community members such as kballard and Nephyrin applied.

Maul is the original author and SLOKnightfall has been maintaining the addon for quite a while now.  All these people rock.

I (AlexFolland) want my 18 MB of incredibly finely-tuned profiles to work in Legion, but they still don't stay for more than one session after being copied via the profile manager.  This is what I seek to solve in my fork.
